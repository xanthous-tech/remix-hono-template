# Remix + Express Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for building web applications with [Remix](https://remix.run) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

## Overview

I plan to add the following:

- [x] Express.js
- [x] Remix + Vite
- [x] TypeScript
- [x] tRPC
- [x] tRPC OpenAPI (for app requests)
- [x] Postgres
- [x] DrizzleORM (to operate Postgres)
- [x] Redis
- [x] BullMQ (via Redis)
- [x] Minio
- [x] TailwindCSS
- [ ] Radix UI Theme
- [x] shadcn/ui
- [x] Auth (via Lucia)
- [x] BiomeJS
- [x] tsup
- [x] Stripe
- [ ] Emails (via Resend / Cloudflare + MailChannels)
  - [x] Magic Link / OTP

This covers all I need for building an app with a web frontend and an API backend.
